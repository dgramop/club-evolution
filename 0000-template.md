## Introduction

A short description of what the feature is. Try to keep it to a single-paragraph "elevator pitch" so the reader understands what problem this proposal is addressing.

## Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the problem is that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show how one can currently get a similar effect and describe its drawbacks. If it's completely new functionality that cannot be emulated, motivate why this new functionality would help club officers create better club environment and experience.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe how they work. Show how your solution is better than current workarounds: is it clearer, easier, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it is a new kind of activity, what is its structure, and how will it help club members? What additional resources does the event require? How are we going to use those resources.

The detail in this section should be sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to reasonably implement the feature.

## Compatibility

How it breaks current situation?

What changes should club members make? Do they have to spend more time in the club, or reschedule their time? Do they have to pay more club dues? 

What changes should club officers make? Do the club officers have to do extra work? 

## Alternatives considered

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and why you chose this approach instead.

## Additional Information (Optional)
Any additional information that can't fit into any of those categories.
