# Oakton Computer Science Evolution Process

This document outlines the Oakton Computer Science Club(the club) evolution process and how a feature grows from a rough idea into something that can improve the club environment and experience for all club members, officers, and sponsors.

## Scope

The club evolution process covers all changes to the club, including new kind of activities, changes to existing customs, removal of existing features, and so on. 

## Goals

The club evolution process aims to leverage the collective ideas, insights, and experience of the club to improve the experience and environment. Its two primary goals are:

* Engage all the club related to participate in the ongoing evolution of the club, and
* Maintain the vision and conceptual coherence of the club.

There is a natural tension between these two goals. Open evolution processes are, by nature, chaotic. The club evolution process aims to strike a balance that best serves the club as a whole.

## Participation

Everyone is welcome to propose, discuss, and review ideas to improve the club. Before posting a review, please see the section "What goes into a review?" below.

The club [officer](https://github.com/orgs/oaktoncsclub/teams/officer) is responsible for the strategic direction of the club. Officers initiate, participate in, and manage the public review of proposals and have the authority to accept or reject changes to the club.

## What goes into a review?

The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of the club. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:

* What is your evaluation of the proposal?
* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to the club?
* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of the club?
* If you have experienced in other club with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?
* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?

Please state explicitly whether you believe that the proposal should be accepted into the club.

## How to propose a change

* **Check prior proposals**: many ideas come up frequently, and may either be in active discussion, or may have been discussed already and have been rejected. Please check those contents before proposing something new.
* **Socialize the idea**: write a rough sketch of the idea, the problems it solves, what the solution looks like, etc., and discuss with someone else.
* **Develop the proposal**: expand the rough sketch into a complete proposal, using the [proposal template](0000-template.md), and continue to refine the proposal. Prototyping an implementation and its uses along with the proposal is encouraged, because it helps ensure both technical feasibility of the proposal as well as validating that the proposal solves the problems it is meant to solve.
* **Request a review**: initiate a pull request to this repository to indicate to the officers that you would like the proposal to be reviewed. When the proposal is sufficiently detailed and clear, and addresses feedback from earlier discussions of the idea, the pull request will be accepted.
* * **Address feedback**: in general, and especially during the review period, be responsive to questions and feedback about the proposal.

## Review process

The review process for a particular proposal begins when a officer accepts a pull request of a new or updated proposal into this repository. That officer becomes the *review manager* for the proposal. The proposal is assigned a proposal number (if it is a new proposal), then enters the review queue.

The review manager will work with the proposal authors to schedule the review. To avoid delays, it is important that the proposal authors be available to answer questions, address feedback, and clarify their intent during the review period.

After the review has completed, the officers will make a decision on the proposal. The review manager is responsible for determining consensus among the officers, then reporting their decision to the proposal authors. The review manager will update the proposal's state to reflect that decision.

States of all proposals are available in [Status panel](https://github.com/oaktoncsclub/club-evolution/projects/1)

## Proposal states
A given proposal can be in one of several states:

* **Awaiting review**: The proposal is awaiting review. Once known, the dates for the actual review will be placed in the project When the review period begins, the review manager will update the state to *Active review*.
* **Scheduled for review (MONTH DAY...MONTH DAY)**: The public review of the proposal has been scheduled for the specified date range.
* **Active review (MONTH DAY...MONTH DAY)**: The proposal is undergoing public review. The review will continue through the specified date range.
* **Returned for revision**: The proposal has been returned from review for additional revision to the current draft.
* **Withdrawn**: The proposal has been withdrawn by the original submitter.
* **Accepted**: The proposal has been accepted and is either awaiting implementation or is actively being implemented.
* **Accepted with revisions**: The proposal has been accepted, contingent upon the inclusion of one or more revisions.
* **Rejected**: The proposal has been considered and rejected.
